HTML Hello World
================

An HTML document is a **plain text file** in which contents are
formatted in **HTML Markup Language**.

In this language every piece of content is placed inside a **TAG**
which is a simple way to **add meanings to words**.

A TAG it is just a text which follow a strict syntax:

    <TagName>
        content, it can contains other tags
    </TagName>

A browser like Chrome or Firefox is able to read such file, understand
it's tag/content structure, finally is able to render a visual version
of the document where tags, contents and other stuff (CSS, Js) are
mixed up into a graphical result.
